    <h1>TYPES OF KEYS</h1>
    <P>2nd JULY 2024 <span>(Day-4)</span></P>

    <h2>Super Key</h2>
    <p>A super key is a set of one or more columns that can be used to uniquely identify a row in a table.
       <ul> 
        <li>All candidate keys are super keys, but not all super keys are candidate keys.</li>
    </ul>
       </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Candidate Key</h2>
    <p>A candidate key is a column or a set of columns that can qualify as a unique key in the database.
       <ul>
        <li>There can be multiple candidate keys in a table.</li>
       <li> One of the candidate keys is chosen as the primary key, while the others are called alternate keys.</li>
    </ul>
    
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Primary Key</h2>
    <p>
        A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table.
        <ul>
        <li>Each table can have only one primary key, which can consist of one or multiple columns.</li>
        <li>Primary keys cannot contain NULL values.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Alternate Key</h2>
    <p>An alternate key is any candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key.
       <ul>
        <li> It is a unique key that could have been chosen as the primary key but was not</li>
    </ul></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Artificial Key</h2>
    <p>
        An artificial key, also known as a surrogate key, is a unique identifier for a record in a database table that is not derived from application data.
        <ul>
       <li>It is typically generated automatically by the database system, such as an auto-incrementing number or a UUID. </li>
    <li> Artificial keys are non-meaningful outside the database context and provide consistency and simplicity for managing relationships between tables. </li>
       
        <li>They help improve performance and ensure data integrity by providing a stable and unique identifier.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Foreign Key</h2>
    <p>A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables.
       <ul>
        <li> It is a reference to the primary key in another table.</li>
        <li>Foreign keys can contain NULL values.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Composite Key</h2>
    <p>
        A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns.
        <ul>
            <li> It is used when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify records.</li>
    </ul></p>
